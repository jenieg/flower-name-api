This is a RESTful API designed for querying flower data based on specified months. Users can make GET requests to the endpoint, providing a 'month' parameter in the URL. The API responds with JSON-formatted data containing information about flowers associated with the specified month.

## Optimizations

I plan to improve this project by incorporating a dedicated backend database in the future. I would also like to expand what json information is returned.
